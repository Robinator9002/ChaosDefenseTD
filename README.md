### Project Overview

**ChaosDefenseTD** is a single-player tower defense game where players build defensive structures to protect their base from waves of enemies. This repository contains the ground-up rewrite of the original [ChaosDefense (Python/Pygame)](https://github.com/Robinator9002/ChaosDefense) project, built this time with a modern web stack: **React, TypeScript, Electron, and Tailwind CSS**.

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a high-performance, data-driven case study, comparing the architecture, development experience, and ultimate performance of a game built with web technologies versus its Python counterpart.

### üéØ Core Concept

While the technology stack has changed, the core vision remains the same. "ChaosDefenseTD" is a tower defense game that pits the player against an intelligent, adaptive enemy. The key innovation lies in the dynamic AI for both enemies and towers, designed to challenge the player's strategies and prevent stale, repetitive gameplay.

### ‚ú® Key Features (Planned)

-   **üß† Adaptive Enemy & Tower AI:** The game will feature intelligent systems that allow enemies to find weak points and towers to prioritize threats effectively, creating a more dynamic battlefield.
-   **üñ•Ô∏è Modern, Performant UI:** Leveraging React and Tailwind CSS to create a beautiful, responsive, and intuitive user interface for all menus, HUDs, and info panels.
-   **‚ö° High-Performance Canvas Rendering:** The core game, with potentially hundreds of entities, will be rendered on an HTML5 `<canvas>` to ensure smooth, high-framerate gameplay.
-   **üîß Data-Driven Architecture:** All tower stats, enemy types, wave compositions, and upgrades are defined in external JSON configuration files, making the game easy to modify and balance.
-   **üó∫Ô∏è Procedural Level Generation:** Levels will be programmatically generated based on stylistic themes, ensuring a unique challenge with every playthrough.

### üí° The "Why": Python vs. React

The original ChaosDefense was born from a desire to create a TD game that learns and evolves with the player. This React version is the next step in that exploration. Can we achieve the same complex logic and AI while harnessing the power of the web for a more visually stunning and accessible experience? This project is an experiment to answer that question, pushing the boundaries of what's possible for a browser-based (via Electron) game.

### üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

This project is in the initial development phase. We are following a structured plan, building the game from the ground up. The current focus is on establishing the foundational architecture, including the data-loading services, state management, and the core game loop.
